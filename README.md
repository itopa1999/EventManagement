1. Project Planning and Research
Define Goals & Objectives: Clarify what your system aims to achieve, like simplifying event planning, registration, or managing multiple events.
Target Users: Determine the target audience (event organizers, attendees, admins, etc.).
Core Functionalities: List out all the core features and tools youâ€™ll provide.
Research Competitors: Look at existing event management tools to see what features they offer, and how you can improve on them.
2. Technical Stack Selection
Backend: ASP.NET Core (MVC)
Frontend: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
Database: SQL Server for storing event and user data
Task Scheduling: Hangfire for background jobs like email notifications
Version Control: Git/GitHub for tracking code changes
API Integration: Integrate third-party tools if needed (payment, calendar, etc.)
3. Project Setup
Backend Setup:
Install .NET Core SDK
Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project (dotnet new mvc)
Setup Entity Framework Core for database migrations
Create and configure the database with SQL Server
Frontend Setup:
Add Bootstrap for responsive layouts
Setup initial layout and views using Bootstrap components
4. Database Design
Tables:
Users (Organizers, Attendees, Admins)
Events (Name, Description, Start/End Time, Location, etc.)
Registrations (User ID, Event ID, Status, etc.)
Notifications (Event ID, User ID, Notification Type, etc.)
Relationships:
One-to-many between organizers and events
Many-to-many between users and events (through registrations)
5. Core Features Implementation
Event Creation & Management
Admin Interface: Build an admin panel where event organizers can:
Create new events
Edit/delete existing events
Set event details (date, time, location, etc.)
CRUD Operations: Implement event creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
User Registration & Confirmation
User Authentication: Use ASP.NET Core Identity for login/registration.
Event Registration: Allow users to register for events.
Confirmation: Send email confirmation upon successful registration using ASP.NET Core Email service.
Calendar View
Display Events in a Calendar: Use a calendar component to display events.
Event Filters: Allow filtering by date, category, or location.
Automated Email Notifications
Notification System: Send out email reminders and notifications before and after events.
Integration with Hangfire: Schedule email jobs using Hangfire for tasks like:
Reminders before events
Post-event feedback requests
Admin Dashboard with Analytics
Data Overview: Provide admins with a dashboard displaying metrics such as:
Total events
Number of registered attendees
Revenue (if applicable)
Real-Time Analytics: Show live statistics on upcoming events, attendee activity, etc.
